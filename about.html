                I am from one of the poorest regions
                in my country with few opportunities
                to succeed in life, but in that region
                we value principles like hard word
                and giving back to the community. I
                worked as a python developer for
                some companies before getting into
                consulting for Deloitte in Senegal. I
                was the valedictorian in my training
                at Sonatel Academy.

                My decision to apply to MEST was driven by my passion for entrepreneurship and my desire to learn from experts in the software
                technology development industry. After researching various programs, I was impressed by MEST's focus on providing a
                comprehensive curriculum that combines technical and business skills.
                The opportunity to network with successful entrepreneurs and gain hands-on experience through the incubator program was a key
                factor in my decision to apply.
